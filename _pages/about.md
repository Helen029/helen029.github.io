## Education
I am currently a Master of Engineering student at Cornell University studying Operations Research and Information Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Operations Research at Cornell University in May 2024.

## Extracurriculars
During my time at Cornell, I enjoyed engaging in many clubs and activities. I was fundraising chair in 2021 for Project Hope, a club that raises awareness for underprivileged education in rural China. I was a member of the Big Red Marching Band, where I was a Show Committee Chair in 2022 and Colorguard Co-Captain in 2023. I was President of the Origami Club in 2023. I was a member of the Business and Operations subteam on the Cornell Autonomous Sailboat Project Team.

## Hobbies

Outside of work and school, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and hiking. On a rainy day I like to play piano, crochet, and make origami.
